# FakeCT — Minimal synthetic CT / voxelization toolkit

Instructions shows how to load a mesh, voxelize it into a CT-like grid,
create in/on/out masks and inspect the result with a simple viewer.

This README includes instructions for installing prerequisites (VS Code, Git, Conda),
cloning the repo, creating an environment, installing the package (editable), and running the demo.

## Your Tasks:
```bash
1- Install the prerequisites
2- Follow the 4 steps of the quickstart guideline to try demo exmaples: demo_cube, demo_sphere, and demo_carotid 
3- Identify user inputs you think is needed needed for the stenosis tool
```

## Prerequisites

Before following the quick start, make sure you have these tools installed. The links go to official installers and the one-liners work on macOS (zsh).

- Visual Studio Code — editor and debugging UI
	- Website: https://code.visualstudio.com/
	- macOS (Homebrew):

		```bash
		brew install --cask visual-studio-code
		```

- Git — version control
	- Website: https://git-scm.com/
	- macOS one-liners (choose one):

		```bash
		# Install Xcode command-line tools (includes git)
		xcode-select --install

		# or via Homebrew
		brew install git
		```

- Conda (Miniconda recommended) — environment and package manager
	# FakeCT — Minimal synthetic CT / voxelization toolkit

	This repository provides a small educational pipeline to convert a surface mesh
	into voxelized "inside / on / out" masks and optionally inspect results with a
	Dash viewer.

	Quick start
	-----------
	The canonical quick start lives in the header of `outputs/stand-alone/fakect.py` —
	that file contains usage examples and platform-specific install notes (conda vs pip).

	Minimal example (conda recommended):

	```bash
	conda create -n fakect python=3.10 -y
	conda activate fakect
	conda install -c conda-forge python-igl trimesh scipy scikit-image plotly dash -y

	python outputs/stand-alone/fakect.py --in data/carotid.stl --n 7 --margin 0.10 \
		--mc-map zyx --out examples/outputs/carotid_masks.npz --no-show
	```

	Notes
	-----
	- `python-igl` is recommended to be installed from `conda-forge` (best cross-platform)
	  — pip installs of `igl` often fail on many systems. If `igl` is not available the
	  stand-alone script will currently exit with an error; I can add an automatic
	  fallback to the parity-based classifier if you prefer.

	If you want, I can add a short `environment.yml` and `requirements.txt` to the repo.
